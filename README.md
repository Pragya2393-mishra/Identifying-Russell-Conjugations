1. Download pre-trained google wordvector files from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f0mQ2cgcx9EWVzJjwSw_3X-7w_NKshTj?usp=sharing
2. Final code for approach 1: Project Execution\Models\Approach1\Pipeline\Final version\Final_pipeline_approach1.py
3. Run this file, after changing the path of the google normed vectors to the path where the files were saved to in step(1)
4. Path to datasets used for training the classifiers:
  Project Execution\Models\Approach1\Pipeline\Final version\Final_pipeline_approach1.py
  Project Execution\Models\Approach1\Sentiment classification\Final version\Final_sentiment_classification_approach1.py
